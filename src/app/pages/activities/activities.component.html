        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p>The activity program for the encampment follows the pattern of a national or world jamboree. There will be dozens of activity areas that provided for the young men. These include traditional summer camp activities such as swimming, archery, and rifle shooting, along with activities such as obstacle courses and paintball archery.</p>
        <p>There will also be a merit badge midway where boys can work on nearly thirty or forty different merit badges. Because the activity program is so much larger than a traditional summer camp, most boys may not complete as many merit badges as they would at a traditional camp. Leaders will need to work closely with their young men to make sure they accomplish what they need to at the encampment while taking part in the wide range of activities.</p>
        <p>Activity and merit badge areas will be open from 2:00pm until 5:00pm on Monday, August 6th. These areas will be open from 9:00am to 12:00pm and 1:30pm to 5:00pm on Tuesday through Friday. This provides a total of 29 hours for boys to participate in the activities and merit badge programs.</p>
        <p>Each participating stake will develop and staff three activity areas and two merit badge areas during the encampment. The encampment staff is working with stake leaders to coordinate the list of activities and merit badges to be offered at the encampment. These details will be posted on the web site as they are finalized.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about your stake’s activities and merit badges or would like to participate in developing these activities, contact your Stake Young Men’s President and offer to assist. We do not need any additional staff at the encampment level to manage these activities, but each stake is going to need a large number of volunteers to staff these areas.</p>
