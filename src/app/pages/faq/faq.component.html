      <p>"Called to Serve" the 2018 LDS Aaronic Priesthood Encampment is fast approaching. Below is a snapshot of information.
        Periodic information from the encampment committee will be provided to keep stakes and individuals up to date as
        they prepare for the encampment. (
        <em>Changes may occur in the information below as planning for the Encampment unfolds</em>)</p>
      <p>Glen Squires, Encampment General Chairman, has been meeting for months setting up committees and working with the BSA
        making preparations for this great event. Each stake has accepted to oversee one or more of the many committees for
        the encampment, chaired by a member of the respective stakes who serves on the Planning Committee. All of these people
        are actively engaged in preparing the encampment to be a once in a lifetime event for each participant.</p>

              <p>Patterned after a National Jamboree, there will be a myriad of activities suited for a group of nearly 2,000
                young men, such as group and individual events, COPE (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience) courses, shooting
                sports, obstacle courses, survival opportunities, a merit badge midway, triathlon, and of course, water activities.
                There will be no water merit badges. We are open to activities to capture young men’s imaginations that a
                Stake may have men with specialties to conduct. Consider incorporating some of the activities listed in the

                <strong>Each stake is to provide 2 merit badges and 3 activities (one spiritually oriented) and the necessary manpower
                  to oversee the activities and merit badges.</strong>

              <p>We are partnering with BSA who will provide some staff for shooting sports, waterfront, COPE courses, etc.
                Still, there are opportunities for stake members to participate as staff. We are particularly reaching out
                to the stakes for help with shooting sports. If individuals need to be trained prior to the Encampment, BSA
                will provide information to us on the training required for various positions to ensure all are trained.
                If you have trained people in shooting sports or people that want to be trained, please let us know through

                All registered scout leaders and merit badge counselors are required
                to have up to date youth protection training prior to the encampment. For everyone else, you are not required to take Youth Protection Training.
                However, the BSA launched a new and updated youth protection training on 2/1 which addresses cyber bullying, online abuse, physical and
                sexual abuse, and neglect, among others. You do not need to be a registered Scout leader to take the new Youth Protection Training.

                To take Youth Protection training go to <a href="https:\\my.Scouting.org">My.Scouting.org</a> and create an account. You’ll receive an

                Stakes will eat at their respective campsites. Each stake will need to have an assigned Head Cook, along
                with several adult assistants for food preparation and distribution. Each stake will need to provide their

            <div id="faq_Budget" class="faq-answer collapse">
              <p>Cost is $210 for each person attending the encampment. This includes those adults who will be running merit badges
                and field events. If an adult does not stay for the entire week and someone replaces them, the two adults count
                as one for the entire week. The payment for all persons will be left up to each Bishop to determine the correct
                amount to pay, on the honor system.</p>
              <p>The $210 fee is the registration fee for the encampment, which includes food, and a t-shirt. Stakes may specify
                a different fee for wards based on how expenses for the encampment are handled within each stake.</p>
              <p>Stakes are responsible to provide the Encampment the $210 per person with payments coming from the stake level
                (Stake Clerk). The Stake decides the portion that they will provide and the portion that each ward and individual
                will be responsible to provide.</p>
              <p>The schedule for payments will be due as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>30% by November 1, 2017</li>
                <li>40% due by April 1, 2018</li>
                <li>30% due by Jul 20, 2018</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This will ensure all costs can be covered as Encampment planning and execution unfolds. Of the $2,000 already
                paid by each stake, $1,000 will be applied to the November 1st payment and $1,000 will be applied to the
                April 1st payment. Payments will be made to: "Spokane Washington North Stake."</p>
              <p>Stakes should consider how many youth and adults from the stake will participate in order to give you an estimate
                for Stake costs.</p>
